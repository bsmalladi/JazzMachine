# JazzMachine

Uses Python libraries to create random "improvised" melodies based on pre-defined chord changes common in jazz music.

This repository contains multiple iterations of the Jazz Machine, and is currently a little scattered and unorganized. If you have any questions about this project, feel free to reach out to me at bmalladi@umich.edu.
